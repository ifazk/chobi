# Chobi (ছবি)
Planned port of Sanoid Rust.

Chobi's sister project [chithi](https://github.com/ifazk/chithi) is currently
being developed.

# ETA when?
Perhaps never. If I get to understand all the features of sanoid and syncoid
through this project, that's more than enough for me.

# Contributing
I am not accepting PRs or contributions to the project. The project isn't ready
for contributions. The code here is GPLv3 through, so you may fork the project
under that license if you'd like to to take the project in a different
direction, or if the updates here are too slow.

# Reporting issues
This project is not accepting any issues. I plan on opening up issues once
enough functionality is implemented.
